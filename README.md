# Gradient-Boosting
Gradient Boosting is a machine learning algorithm that is used for regression and classification problems. It is a type of ensemble learning method that combines several weak learners (also known as base models) to create a strong predictive model.

The basic idea behind Gradient Boosting is to sequentially add new models to the ensemble that attempt to correct the errors made by the previous models. Each new model is fitted to the residual errors of the previous models, with the goal of minimizing the overall error.

### The algorithm proceeds as follows:

- A simple model (such as a decision tree) is fitted to the data.
- The errors of the model are calculated by comparing the predicted values to the true values.
- A new model is then fitted to the errors of the previous model, with the goal of minimizing the error.
- The errors of the new model are added to the errors of the previous model, and the process is repeated until the overall error is minimized.

Gradient Boosting is known to be a powerful and versatile algorithm, and has been successfully applied to a wide range of problems in various fields, including finance, biology, and computer vision. However, it can be computationally expensive and prone to overfitting, so care must be taken when selecting the hyperparameters and training the model.
